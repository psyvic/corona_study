# Guided Project: Visualizing Real World Data

## Overview

The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

 - Select a dataset from a public source
 - Create a Jupyter notebook to analyze the data
 - Using your data, create a minimum of one scatter plot, one histogram, one box plot and one bar graph (you can add more than one visualization of each type of you choose)
 Graphs should contain the proper labeling of the x and y axis and units of the quantities plotted (if applicable) as well as a title for the graph
 - Feel free to use matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly as you see fit to best convey
   the message and the story behind the data
 - Use markdown cells to break down the notebook with title, introduction, sub sections (if needed) and a conclusion section. Notebook title, introduction and
   conclusions are mandatory
 - Use the notebook and markdown to guide the reader through your analysis and tell the story
   Explain what insight or information is inferred from these visualizations
 - The notebook should be a self sufficient document. Someone with no exposure to the problem should be able to read the notebook and understand your analysis 
 - Make extensive use of comments, docstrings and markdown

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your branch:

- **A Jupyter notebook** containing your analysis and the code you used to obtain this analysis. Place the Jupyter notebook in the `your-code` folder
- **An empty data folder** with a read me file inside that explains the data set
- **DATA** Please do not upload any data to the repository but place a link to the data in your jupyter notebook as we usually do 
  You can then ask the reader in the notebook to download the data and place them locally in the provided empty data folder. The link in the notebook can point to the original data set or to our google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D1iseKNOy50mqo31FkuQbID-zfCyijZD?usp=sharing) where you can store the data. The exact raw data set you used should be linked. 


## Resources and suggestions

* **Find a data set to process** <br>
A great place to start looking would be <br>
[Awesome Public Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)<br> 
[Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)<br>
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)<br> 
A great new source is the <br> [Google dataset search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch)
* **Resources for Markdown in Jupyter** <br>
    * [Short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBCB23pQeIA)
    * [Article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-jupyter-notebook-formatting-guide-873ab39f765e)
    * You may also find inspiration from the jupyter notebooks you have worked on for your labs
* **Perform Preliminary Analysis** - use functions like `describe` to help guide you to the correct insight and data visualization
* **Use the tools in your tool kit** - your knowledge of the different types of visualizations and when to use them should come in handy with this assignment
* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want


## Useful questions to ask yourself

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?


This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

## Presentation Guideline and Criteria

### Format

* Presentation Time: 12 minutes max
* Q & A: 3 minutes
* **Total Time:** 15 minutes

### Outputs

* Present your findings using the Jupyter notebook you have developed, **no slides and no power point presentation**
* Be prepared to explain your entire notebook guiding us trough your thought process

### Things you might want to talk about

* Short presentation of yourself:
	* Who are you?
	* Your favorite thing about this course so far
* Introduction
  * Describe the dataset you chose
  * Why did you choose that dataset?
  * The most important thing you learned
* The code
    * Be prepared to explain your code as well as markdown comments 
* The visualizations
    * What Python library you chose for each visualization and why
    * How did you implement the visualization
* Your insight
    * Explain what insight you derived from the visualizations and what this tells us about the data
