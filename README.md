# Coronavirus Demographic Visualization and Country comparison

## Overview

The goal of this project is to fight misinformation and gain a better understanding of the demographics affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and a comparison/impact of each country.

The dataset used for this project was recovered from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset) on April 1st 2020. If there is more recent data in a similar structure it can be used with this notebook for  the interactive visualizations, but the conclusions drawn are valid for the data colected until April 1st. 

For some extra analysis, information was recovered from Our World In Data(https://ourworldindata.org/) to get some insight on countries population.

For ease of use, all the datasets used are on this repository, but the datasets can be downloaded directly from their sources aforementioned.

In order to use the notebook work you will need the following packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- time
- datetime
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- ipywidgets
- plotly

Also it is better to use jupyter notebook instead of lab as some interactive plots do not show correctly on jupyter lab.
