 Victor investigated the Coronavirus pandemics. The visualizations are exceptional and very interactive, you went out of your way to explore the limits of  interactive visualizations using also new packages. Fantastic work!  The story is well told and the notebook is well documented with introduction, conclusions and numerous markdown sections to explain the analysis. The data used are clearly indicated and provided on google drive. Some more technical feedback is in the notebook itself.  As a next step in the data pipeline please make also a data folder with a .md file in it that asks the reader to store the data in it, as we do in the labs, and push that as well. That way the reader is really guided towards the data and the notebook is fully self sufficient, otherwise me, as external reader has to create a data folder and that leads to the fact that the file paths in the notebook may not work directly. Also make sure there are not spaces in filenames.
